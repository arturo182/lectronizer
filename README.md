# Lectronizer

![Lectronizer](./res/preview.png)

A client for the [lectronz.com](https://www.lectronz.com/) maker marketplace.

Still in early development. Many things might not work or be broken.

# Building

The project is written in Qt, tested with Qt 6.2 but should work with other Qt 6 releases and potentially even Qt 5.

You can open the project in Qt Creator and just build it there or from the command line:

    git clone https://github.com/arturo182/lectronizer.git
    cd lectronizer
    qmake .
    make -j
